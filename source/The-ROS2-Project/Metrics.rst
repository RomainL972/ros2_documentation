We measure aspects of the ROS community to understand and track the impact of our work and identify areas for improvement.
We take inspiration from the MeeGo Project's metrics.

Metrics.ros.org
---------------

At `metrics.ros.org <https://metrics.ros.org>`_ you can find many visualizations of metrics about ROS.

Periodic Metrics Report
-----------------------

We periodically publish a metrics report that provides a quantitative view of the ROS community.
We're collectively learning what to measure and how and evoloving as systems change.
Please provide feedback! Add your suggestions on how to improve these reports by posting them to `ROS Discourse Site Feedback Category <http://discourse.ros.org/c/site-feedback>`_
